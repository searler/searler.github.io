The [TexShare CARD](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/texshare/card) provides access to libraries beyond your local public libraries,
including various universities. 

My nearest participating university is University of Texas at Dallas. A quick search of their catalog indicated
they had an interesting range of computer science books. I then proceed to their library with my new card in hand. 

There I discovered that all the new books are *only* available in ebook form. The newest dead tree book was dated
2010 and those were very scarce. Similarly the most recent paper periodical is from 2005. 

Unfortunately the TexShare CARD does not cover ebooks.
