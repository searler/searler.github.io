The May 2015 CACM article [There is No Now](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/5/186019-there-is-no-now/abstract)
describes the common distributed database approach of _last write wins_ as really meaning
_many writes, chosen unpredictably, will be lost_! This is quite apposite for any one who 
has seen the results of the [Jepsen test tool](https://aphyr.com/posts). 

Of course, the latter term would never be permitted by the marketing team.
