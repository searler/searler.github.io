The first step in considering how to better integrate Scala and Java XML processing is a Google search to find the prior art.

That found the following <a href="http://www.scalaforum.se/scala-for-java-developers/scala-xml-java-xpath-implicit-conversions/">gem</a>. The scala.xml.Elem is <strong>prettyprinted</strong> to a String and then parsed into a DOM for processing by the Java xpath implementation.

This code illustrates a common concern with tools that hide the implementation details; they often hide significant performance problems. It might be argued that Scala implicit conversions will make this anti-pattern a common occurrence.
