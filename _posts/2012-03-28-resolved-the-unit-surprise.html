<code>f{() => println("2")}</code> calls f with a value that is a function.

Scala has a special case where expressions with a return type of Unit discard any value that might otherwise be returned.
In this case, the expression is<code>() => println("2")</code>. The resultant Unit matches the signature of f, which explains why the compiler does not complain.
