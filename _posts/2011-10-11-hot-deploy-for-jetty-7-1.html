The documentation is not very helpful.

The log output indicates the server notices when a new war is dropped into the webapps directory, but further action is taken.

Turns an unmodified install will perform a hot deploy so long as the application is referenced by a context file and that file is touched.

That is easily arranged as part of an ant build.
