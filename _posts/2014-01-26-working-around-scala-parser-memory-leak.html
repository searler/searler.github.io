This <a href="https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4929">ticket</a>Â covers an ongoing issue with the parser combinators. The last fix replaced the thread safety issue with a memory leak.That was unfortunate since it fairly easy to deal with the thread safety limitation. Resolving the memory leak requires more heroic efforts, illustrated by this <a href="https://github.com/NET-A-PORTER/scala-uri/commit/2541904066a6be114be884a0c75b5f72cb00959a">code</a>.

This issue has forced me to remain on Scala 2.9.x, which is becoming less tenable as time passes. The ticket implies that 2.11 will contain a fix, but there is no evidence of any change in the current code.

Reworking the code to use the phrase combinator side-steps the memory leak and allows an upgrade to Scala 2.10.x

{% highlight scala %}
def rawParse(reader: Reader[Char]) = parse(rootParser, reader)
{% endhighlight %}

becomes

{% highlight scala %}
def rawParse(reader: Reader[Char]) = {
 parse(phrase(capture(rootParser) ~ dropDead), reader) match {
 case Success(wrapped, _) =>
 wrapped match {
 case result ~ in => result match {
 case ns : NoSuccess => ns
 case _ => Success(result, in)
 }
 }
 case ns: NoSuccess => ns //should not be seen
 }

private val dropDead = Parser { in => Success(in, new CharSequenceReader("")) }

private def capture[T](p: => Parser[T]) = Parser { in =>
 p(in) match {
 case ns : NoSuccess => Success(ns,in)
 case _ @ s => s
 }
 }
{% endhighlight %}
