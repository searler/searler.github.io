<p>The previous <a href="http://cognitiveentity.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/choreography-using-akka-futures-1/">post</a> described a choreography implementation using Futures.</p>
<p>All technologies need to consider testability, which is thus the topic of this post.</p>
<p>The first step is a completely self contained unit test mechanism. This allows the testing of the business logic embodied in the service, without the complexity of the concurrent runtime environment.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/">specs2</a> test for the Balance service might be</p>
<pre><code>"balance" in {
    Balance(Acct("alpha")).get must beEqualTo(Bal(124.5F))
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <em>get</em> which blocks until the future returns its result.</p>
<p>The Balance service requires a suitable mock implementation of Lookup[Acct, Bal].</p>
<pre><code>implicit val balLook: Lookup[Acct, Bal] = Service(Map(Acct("alpha") -> Bal124.5F))


private abstract class MapService[K, V](map: Map[K, V]) {
    self: Function1[K, Future[V]] =>
    def apply(a: K) = Future(map(a))
}

private case class Service[K, V](values: Map[K, V]) extends MapService(values) with Lookup[K, V]
</code></pre>
<p>The implicits eliminate the need to explicitly reference the balLook, much like Spring auto wiring by type.</p>
