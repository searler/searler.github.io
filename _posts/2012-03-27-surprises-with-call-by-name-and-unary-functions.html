I recently created a subtle defect while using the Play2 <a href="http://scala.playframework.org/documentation/api/2.0/scala/index.html#play.api.libs.iteratee.Enumerator$">enumerators</a>

Both  pushee and fromCallback are passed an onComplete that is executed when the target Iteratee can no longer accept any input. The signatures are slightly different
<pre>pushee:onComplete: ⇒ Unit
fromCallback:onComplete: () ⇒ Unit</pre>
I did not notice the difference and used <code> {() => println("completed")} </code> in each case. That prints the expected output for fromCallback but is not executed for pushee. The compiler does not generate any errors, making this a completely silent failure. Thanks to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/play-framework/pushee/play-framework/KmbjwlJUe50/ddVqKTV0tyUJ">sadek</a> for pointing out my error.

The next step was to gain a better understanding of this corner of the Scala language

{% highlight scala %}
def f(a: => Unit){a}
def g(a:() => Unit){a()}
def h(a: => String)={a}
def i(a:() => String)={a()}

f{println("1")}
f{() => println("2")}
g{() => println("3")}
println(h{"5"})
println(h{()=>"6"})
println(i{() => "7"})
{% endhighlight %}
The result is</pre>
1
3
5
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
found : () => java.lang.String
required: String
println(h{()=>"6"})
^
7

So there is something special about <code>() => Unit</code>
