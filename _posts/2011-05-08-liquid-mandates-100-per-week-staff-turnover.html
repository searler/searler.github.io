<h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;color:#444444;line-height:24px;">Each work item is 3-5 days of effort, performed by a person randomly selected from a pool.</span></h2>
<h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;color:#444444;line-height:24px;"> The likelihood that any other work item will be performed by the same person will be small, presumably essentially zero. A high revisit probability would indicate the pool is rather small, negating the basic principles of Liquid.</span></h2>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;color:#444444;line-height:24px;">Thus the developer staff will completely at least change once a week.</span>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">Mythical Man Month </a>describes how communication costs can destroy projects. Fred Brooks was only concerned with consequences of adding new people, not wholesale replacement!
