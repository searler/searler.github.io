<p>The<a href="http://cognitiveentity.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/play-2-server-sent-events-and-ajax-performance/"> realtime UI</a> design was recreated using websockets and Play2.</p><p>Latency is ~ 1.6 ms and CPU load ~85%.</p><p>The latency is 10x better than the alternatives, which would be expected.<br />The loading did not increase 10x, which is helpful. </p>
