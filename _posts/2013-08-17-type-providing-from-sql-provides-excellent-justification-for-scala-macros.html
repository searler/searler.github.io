<a href="https://github.com/jonifreeman/sqltyped">sqltyped</a> processes SQL statements to extract the DDL details and then uses macros to generate type safe code.

This provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> implementation where the database schema is the master and errors in the referencing code are detected at compile time.
