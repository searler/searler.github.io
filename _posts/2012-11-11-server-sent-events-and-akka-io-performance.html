The <a href="http://cognitiveentity.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/play-2-server-sent-events-and-ajax-performance/">experiment</a> was extended with an <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/io.html">Akka IO</a> implementation, using <a href="https://gist.github.com/4051806">https://gist.github.com/4051806</a> as the basis.

Latency is 16ms and CPU load 12%
The former is a little worse than the alternatives and the loading falls between them.
The IO implementation is merely a sample, so there is likely some performance improvement to be had.
