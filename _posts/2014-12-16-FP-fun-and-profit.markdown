This [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/fp-patterns-ndc-london2014) covers FP _patterns_, using
realistic examples. The description of monads is very clear (and does not involve elephants or buritos).

Another [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/domain-driven-design-with-the-f-type-system-functional-londoners-2014) by the same other covers how to use a strongly typed functional language to model the business domain.

The author also has an interesting [web site](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) and a book in [progress](https://leanpub.com/understandingfunctionalprogramming).
