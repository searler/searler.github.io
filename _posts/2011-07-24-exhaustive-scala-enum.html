This interesting <a href="http://klangism.tumblr.com/post/7098500142/diy-exhaustiveness-checking-on-scala-enums">post</a> describes how to define an enum in Scala such that the compiler will flag a failure to exhaustively cover all the options. It also provides an implementation of <em>values</em>, which is often very useful.

However, I found the gist did not function under either Scala 2.8.1 or 2.9.0-1. The compiler would falsely indicate that not all options were covered.  Using objects rather than vals resolved the problem.

Arguably this is a clearer representation since Enum values are singletons.  It also avoids some of the "boilerplate" nature of the vals implementation, while retaining the compiler checking.
<pre>object Foos extends Enum {
  sealed trait EnumVal extends Value
  object F extends EnumVal { val name = "F" }
  object X extends EnumVal { val name = "X" }
}</pre>
Unfortunately, this implementation does not populate the <em>values</em> until each object is explicitly referenced.
