Both specs and sbt 0.11 by default run tests in parallel.

In general, this is a good idea. It utilizes the resources of modern multicore systems and helps to flush out inadvertent multithreading defects.

It is a really bad idea when the tests were not written to be thread safe!

Two separate and a little obscure configuration changes are required.

In the build.sbt add:
<pre>parallelExecution in Test := false</pre>
With in the specification, add a sequential entry. For example:
<pre>class Test extends Specification {
   sequential</pre>
