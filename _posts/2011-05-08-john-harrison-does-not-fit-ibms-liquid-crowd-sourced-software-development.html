IBM have created a crowd sourcing software development model (Liquid) , described in this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=204531626237821">video</a>

The example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harrison's</a> development of a chronometer to win the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_Prize">Longitude Prize</a>  is given as an example and justification of Liquid.  Consider the following features of John Harrison's work:
<ul>
	<li>Prize amount of ~ $5 million dollars (equivalent)</li>
	<li>16 years from establishment of prize until Harrison draw up his initial proposal</li>
	<li>5 years to build first prototype marine clock</li>
	<li>5 years to build and test second prototype</li>
	<li>17 years to work on unsuccessful third prototype</li>
	<li>6 years to build prototype marine watch</li>
	<li>Never received full award (which was never awarded to any person)</li>
	<li>Had to petition  the King to receive even the partial award.</li>
</ul>
