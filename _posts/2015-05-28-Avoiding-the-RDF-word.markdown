Section 2.3 (Graph Schemas) of the [Big Data](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343) book describes a _graph schema_ with three core components:

* Nodes are the entities in the system
* Edges are the relationships between nodes
* Properties are information about entities (composed of a name and a value)

This is an RDF model, where Edge is a specialized Property.

The term _Equivs_ appears many times through out the book, with the same meaning as _owl:sameAs_.
