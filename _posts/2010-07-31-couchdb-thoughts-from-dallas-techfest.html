The <a href="http://dallastechfest.com/">Dallas TechFest</a> had an interesting presentation on <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> by <a href="http://davisworld.org/blojsom/blog/">Scott Davis.</a>

Most of the attendees expressed various degrees of shock, horror and disbelief! The concepts of CouchDB are certainly very unusual for developers with a SQL background.

Those concepts are much more familiar to Lotus Notes developers and it might be useful to revisit the design patterns used in creating Notes applications.
