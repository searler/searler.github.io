The sbt documentation always indicates that file path must be absolute, but all
examples are relative to project base. That leaves it a little unclear as to how files outside
of the project directory might be referenced.

I created a polyglot project with an Akka backend and React.js frontend. 
These were placed in separate directories since the linkage is small and at arms-length. There
was no need to determine how to integrate webpack into sbt. 

Deployment into the test environment required a fat-jar, generated by sbt-assembly. 
The fat-jar needed to include the js and html files from the webpack build process. 

The solution turns out to to be simple, even obvious.

```
unmanagedResourceDirectories in Compile += file("../../react/build")
```

or


```
unmanagedResourceDirectories in Compile += file("/home/rsearle/work/react/build")
```

The assembly plugin unfortunately does not (AFAIK) allow the specification of resources that are
only included during the actual packaging process.
