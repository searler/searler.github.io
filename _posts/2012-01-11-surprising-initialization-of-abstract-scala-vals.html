Consider the problem of computing deltas between entries in a stream of events.  Each event is paired with the previous value and delivered to a derived implementation. This requires an initial value to be paired with initial value, what might be called the <em>zero</em>.

{% highlight scala %}
package function
trait Delta[T] {
   def zero: T
   private var before: T = zero
   def update(current: T) {
      if (before != current) {
         delta(before, current)
         before = current
      }
   }
   def delta(before: T, current: T)
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, the zero is provided by an abstract function.

The implementation might then be

{% highlight scala %}
case class StringDelta extends Delta[String] {
def zero = ""
def delta(before: String, current: String) {
      println(before, current)
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

&nbsp;

This works fine, but looks a little odd. The zero is a constant, which one might expect to be defined using a <em>val</em>. Changing <em>def zero</em> to <em>val zero</em> compiles (Scala permits abstract vals) but the run-time value is actually <strong>null</strong>.

Changing the definition to be lazy, i.e.<em> lazy val zero = "" , </em>restores the desired behavior. The underlying implementation of lazy is obviously rather similar to def, being executed on first reference to the name.
