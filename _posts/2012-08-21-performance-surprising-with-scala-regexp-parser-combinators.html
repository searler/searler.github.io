The various <a href="https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Parsing">examples</a> generally have the form

<code>def</code> <code>identifier  </code><code>=</code> <code>""</code><code>"[_\p{L}][_\p{L}\p{Nd}]*"</code><code>""</code><code>.r</code>

This works fine, but the underlying Java Pattern is recompiled on every reference.

The behavior came to light during an upgrade from Java 6 and Scala 2.7.7 to Java 7 and Scala 2.9.2, when a ~ 10% performance degradation was noted.
Performance analysis indicated an unexpected large number of calls to <code>Pattern.compile</code>.
The Java 7 implementation is evidently somewhat slower.

Changing the def to val resolves the problem, without impact to the semantics.
In this case, the improvement was greater than 30% which  more than compensates for the degradation.
