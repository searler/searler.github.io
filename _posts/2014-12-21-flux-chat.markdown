The [https://github.com/fdecampredon/rx-flux](rx-flux) project provides two interesting examples,
but no guidance as to how these are to be executed.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/fdecampredon/rx-flux.git
cd rx-flux/examples/flux-chat
npm install ../../
npm install
browserify js/app.js -o js/bundle.js
{% endhighlight %}


Open index.html in a browser.

Change directory to ```rx-flux/examples/flux-todomvc``` and follow the same process.
