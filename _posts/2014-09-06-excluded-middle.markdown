The June 1024 issue of Communications of the ACM has an interesting article by Erik Meijer (famous for LINQ and Reactive Extensions)
called _The Curse of the Excluded Middle_. The premise of the article is that "mostly functional" programming does not work. 

The discussion on Monads is particularly interesting: they are the means by which a pure function interacts with the environment, i.e.
has side effects.
