          <h2>Seeing noSQL as a dual of SQL</h2>
<p class="meta">11 May 2011</p>

<div class="post">
The May 2011 edition of the CACM has interesting article that claims noSQL databases are are merely a variant of SQL databases. The authors describe how noSQL can be seen as a mathematical dual of SQL, replacing sets with monads.

A mathematical model underlying noSQL systems would have several benefits:
<ol>
	<li>An answer for those who consider SQL more powerful/appropriate/cooler since it has a sound theoretical basis.</li>
	<li>Allow for possibility of standardization across the current multitude of largely incompatible systems</li>
	<li>Guide further improvements in functionality.</li>
</ol>
Sets are quite familiar and covered in high school mathematics. Â Monads are famously opaque, with many conflicting metaphors being used to describe them. The usefulness of the CACM article is thus limited by the lack of a good explanation of monads!

A set of slides on coSQL by the CACM authors are <a href="http://gotocon.com/dl/jaoo-brisbane-2010/slides/ErikMeijer_bKeynotebExploringNoSQL.pdf">available</a>.
